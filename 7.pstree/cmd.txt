Verify that systemd on Linux (using pstree) is the root process of all processes (will not work on containers, only on VMs or actual Linux Machines).


sudo apt update

sudo apt install psmisc


pstree -p

systemd(1)─┬─
           ├─
           └─

           

systemd(1) — PID 1 means the very first process started by the Linux kernel.

All other processes (like sshd, cron, bash, etc.) are shown as children of systemd.

 This proves that systemd is the root of all processes.
